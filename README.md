# Ahoy Spark Hackathon 2024 attendees! ðŸ‘‹

If you've ever been to an Umbraco hackathon before you'll know it's traditionally the place where we all clone a copy of the Umbraco source code and start trying to fix bugs or build small features.
We're happy for you to come along and do this again, but we also want to give you new options that might be interesting to you. 

We [have a list ready](https://github.com/orgs/umbraco-community/projects/3/views/1) for you with small projects that we think would be great to work on. They are designed to encourage collaborative learning. You're encouraged to form small teams around a subject that you find interesting from this list. 

Don't worry introverts and lone wolves: group work isn't mandatory!

By the time you get to this hackathon, [the first beta of Umbraco 14 will be out](https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-product-update-february-2024/), so some of the available projects will focus on getting your hands dirty with the latest and greatest.

> [!NOTE]  
> Homework alert! If you want to come prepared, we have the following resources ready:
> - [Documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-backoffice/fundamentals/setup/install)
> - [A whole string of blog posts from Kevin Jump](https://dev.to/kevinjump)
> - [A recent UmbraCollab on creating a very simple property editor for v14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arztzoXqFzM)
> 
> We greatly recommend watching the UmbraCollab video (hint, you can set it to 1.5 speed ðŸ˜‰) for a good foundation.

Additionally, on the board there is projects to help improve community initiatives like [UmbraCalendar](https://umbracalendar.com/), [UMB.FYI](https://umb.fyi/) and a [debugger for Web Components](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.DevTools).

## ðŸ’¬ Happy to chat

ðŸ’¡ If you have ideas of your own, let us know so we can add them to the board. The easiest way to do so is to have a GitHub issue ready that we can link to.

The organizers are [Lotte Pitcher](https://umbracocommunity.social/@lotte) and [Sebastiaan Janssen](https://cultiv.social/@sebastiaan) and we can be best reached in the `#contributing` channel on [the Umbraco Discord server](http://discord.umbraco.com).

See you soon!
